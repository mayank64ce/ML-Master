You are participating in a machine learning task.

You will be given a machine learning task. You must solve the task by training a model and running the model on the test set to produce a submission file. You may not hand-label the data to produce a submission file.

BENCHMARK INSTRUCTIONS
------
- **Competition-specific instructions**: The instructions for the competition are available below and in `input/description.md`.
- **Dataset**: The dataset files for the competition are available in `input/`.
- **Submission**: You MUST produce a submission file at `submission/submission.csv`. We will only evaluate submissions found at this path.
- **Test set**: The test set does not contain the target column `price`. Predict it for each row.
- **Submission checker**: You can validate your submission format by posting to `http://localhost:5001/validate`.

Your goal is to achieve the best possible RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) score on the test set.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
------
- **Total Runtime**: You have a maximum of 1 hour to attempt this task.
- **Total Steps**: You have a maximum of 20 steps to submit your solution.
- Use as much of the available time as possible to refine and optimize your submission.

# House Price Prediction

## Description

Predict the sale price of houses based on their features. This is a regression task.

## Features

The training data (`input/train.csv`) contains the following columns:
- `Id`: Unique identifier for each house
- `sqft`: Square footage of the house (800–4000)
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms (1–5)
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms (1–3)
- `age`: Age of the house in years (0–50)
- `garage`: Number of garage spaces (0–2)
- `price`: **Target variable** — sale price of the house in USD

The test data (`input/test.csv`) contains the same columns except `price`.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** on the `price` column. Lower is better.

## Submission File

For each `Id` in the test set, you must predict the `price`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Id,price
501,250000
502,310000
...
```

## Files
- `input/train.csv` - training data with target `price` column (500 rows)
- `input/test.csv` - test set without `price` column (100 rows)
- `input/sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format
